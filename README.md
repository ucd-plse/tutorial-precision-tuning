## Precimonious Exercises

__(For more detailed instructions on how to run Precimonious that may be
helpful for those looking to modify parameters or adapt the precision
search to another target, see `Note` below)__

### Exercise : simpsons
Change to working directory
```
cd /root/precimonious/exercise-1
```
Creates LLVM bitcode file and optimized executable for later use
```
make clean
make
```
Run analysis on simpsons. The number of configurations will depend on the machine used for the experiment. The number of configurations usually ranges from 70 to 110.
```
./run-analysis.sh simpsons
```
You can find all output files at:
```
ls results
```
Apply result configuration
```
./run-config.sh simpsons
```
Compare performance
```
time ./original_simpsons.out
time ./tuned_simpsons.out
```
Reference results
```
ls reference
```
### Exercise 2 : funarc
Steps for Exercise-2 are similar to Exercise-1
```
cd /root/precimonious/exercise-2
make clean
make
./run-analysis.sh funarc
./run-config.sh funarc
time ./original_funarc.out
time ./tuned_funarc.out
```
## HiFPTuner Exercises
### Exercise : simpsons
Change to working directory
```
cd /root/HiFPTuner/exercise-1
```
Create LLVM bitcode file for simpsons, "simpsons.bc" 
(the generated executable, "original_simpsons.out", will be used later for performance comparison)
```
make clean
make
```
Run HiFPTuner on "simpsons.bc"
```
./run-hifptuner.sh simpsons
```
You can find all output files at:
```
./results-hifptuner
  result file
  - dd2_valid_simpsons.bc.json   : the precision configuration file HiFPTuner generated for simpsons
  log files
  - log.txt, log                 : search log of HiFPTuner
  - sorted_partition.json        : the community structure of floating-point variables
  - auto-tuning_analyze_time.txt : dependence analysis time
  - auto-tuning_config_time.txt  : community detecton time
```
Generate the tuned executable : "hifptuner_tuned_simpsons.out"
```
./run-config.sh simpsons
```
Now time the execution of the original executable and the tuned executable and observe the seepup.
```
time ./original_simpsons.out
time ./hifptuner_tuned_simpsons.out
```
-------------------------------------------
Compare HiFPTuner with Precimonious:

Run Precimonious on "simpsons.bc"
```
./run-preci.sh simpsons
```
You can find all output files at:
```
./results-preci
  result file
  - dd2_valid_simpsons.bc.json   : the precision configuration file Precimonious generated for simpsons
  log files
  - log.txt, log                 : search log of Precimonious
```
Generate the tuned executable: "preci_tuned_simpsons.out"
```
./run-config.sh simpsons
```
Time the execution of the tuned executable of HiFPTuner and Precimonious, and compare them:
```
time ./original_simpsons.out
time ./hifptuner_tuned_simpsons.out
time ./preci_tuned_simpsons.out
```
Compare the search time of HiFPTuner and Precimonious:
```
cat results-hifptuner/log.txt
cat results-preci/log.txt
```
### Exercise 2: funarc
Exercise 2 contains test "funarc.c" and its configuration files and can be run with the same steps shown in Exercise 1
```
cd /root/HiFPTuner/exercise-2
make clean
make

./run-hifptuner.sh funarc
./run-config.sh funarc
time ./original_funarc.out
time ./hifptuner_tuned_funarc.out

./run-preci.sh funarc
./run-config.sh funarc
time ./original_funarc.out
time ./preci_tuned_funarc.out
time ./hifptuner_tuned_funarc.out
cat results-preci/log.txt
cat results-hifptuner/log.txt
```

## Note: More Detailed Instructions for Running Precimonious

Target source code must be annotated with code for checking
error thresholds, measuring timing, logging results, and dummy
calls to any lowered-precision functions that are candidates for
switching out with existing calls.

Of particular note is the error threshold used to ascertain correctness;
this is specified by the value of `epsilon` in the source code of the target
program and must be saved to a file called `spec.cov`. The generation of `spec.cov`
is handled by a call to the `cov_spec_log` function in the target source. Note that
there is a previously-generated `spec.cov` file provided in the repo.

However, those wishing to change the error threshold for the
experiment can follow these steps. For the following instructions, note that `$(TARGET)` refers to the
name of the target source code file without its file extension, i.e.
`simpsons.c` becomes `simpsons`.

0. Set the desired value of `epsilon` in the `$(TARGET)`
    and then be sure that the call to `cov_spec_log()` is uncommented.
1. Annotated source code, auxiliaries, and
   utilities must be compiled to bitcode and then linked to generate
   `$(TARGET).bc`. See slides-sc19.pdf and Makefiles of the examples.
2. Remove any previously-generated `spec.cov` file, if it exists. 
3. Execute `original_$(TARGET).out` to do one-time generation of
   `spec.cov` which contains error threshold information for the
   ensuing execution of the Precimonious search.
4. Comment out generating line of code for `spec.cov` in `$(TARGET)`
   source code. This line contains a call to the function `cov_spec_log()`.
5. Repeat step 1 to recompile and relink target source code,
   auxiliaries, and utilities.
6. Execute `$CORVETTE_PATH/scripts/dependencies.sh $(TARGET)
   $(TARGET_FUNC)` to generate `include.txt` and `include_global.txt`
   which contain lists of discovered functions and global variables to be
   included in the search space. For the examples, `$(TARGET_FUNC)` is
   `main`.
7. Manually create `exclude.txt` and `exclude_local.txt` which contain
   lists of functions and local variables to be excluded from the
   search space.
8. If running one of the examples, execute the included
   `run-analysis.sh` script a la `./run-analysis.sh $(TARGET)`. This
   script performs the following actions (along with pretty-printing
   results):
    - ensures correct environment variables are set for LLVM and
     Precimonious scripts
    - creates a JSON file containing the initial configuration via
      `$CORVETTE_PATH/scripts/pconfig.sh $(TARGET)`
    - creates a JSON file detailing the search space via
      `$CORVETTE_PATH/scripts/search.sh $(TARGET)`
    - runs the search via `$CORVETTE_PATH/scripts/dd2.py $(TARGET).bc
      search_$(TARGET).json config_$(TARGET).json`
   
   The above steps may be run individually.
